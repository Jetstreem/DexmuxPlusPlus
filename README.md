# History
This repo is a merger of

[@Yisus7u7's XFCE Repo](https://github.com/Yisus7u7/termux-desktop-xfce)

[@Yisus7u7's LXQt Repo](https://github.com/termux-desktop/termux-desktop-lxqt)

## This also probably merges
[@adi1090x's Openbox repo](https://github.com/adi1090x/termux-desktop)

Openbox branch is not in this repo yet because i have no interest in ricing window managers.

# Available environments/WindowManagers (with Flavors)
XFCE, LXQt, and Openbox

# Why no MATE desktop environment?
Termux's set of MATE packages itself is outdated.
