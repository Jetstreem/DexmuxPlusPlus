# termux-desktop
(un)Official repo for Desktop Environment Installations 

# History
This repo is a merger of
[@Yisus7u7's XFCE Repo]()
[@Yisus7u7's LXQt Repo]()

## This also probably merges
[adi1090x's Openbox repo]()

# Available environments/window Managers (with Flavors)
XFCE, LXQt, and Openbox

# Why no MATE desktop environment?
Termux's set of MATE packages itself is outdated.
